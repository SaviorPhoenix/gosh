Gosh

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tywkeene/gosh.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tywkeene/gosh)

This is a simple shell I'm writing, much like the old sh to teach myself Go.

Some features include: command execution, tab completion of file and directory
names, changing directory and environment variable adding, setting, getting and
deleting.

Feel free to let me know if I'm doing something wrong or you want to help me
out. It's best to reach me on twitter (@tywkeene) or over email
(tyrell.wkeene@gmail.com)
